# 👋 Hello, World! I’m Brian Santos

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I am a young person who is extremely curious about technology. This is evident in the fact that I am always seeking new knowledge and skills of any kind that can help me find increasingly simple, sophisticated solutions, always with a good dose of creativity. It is a challenging task, but the effort is always worthwhile. At the same time that I am deeply passionate about this world, I also consider myself new to it, which means I still have many lessons to learn, please feel free to share your knowledge with me, I would love it. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer.
